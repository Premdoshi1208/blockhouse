# Order Flow Analysis

This project performs an analysis of order flow imbalance (OFI) and its cross-impact on stock price changes. It includes generating synthetic data, calculating OFI metrics, performing cross-impact analysis, and visualizing the results.

## Folder Structure
- `data/`: Contains the synthetic datasets (order book and trade data).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for analysis and results.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for generating data, preprocessing, OFI calculation, and cross-impact analysis.
- `results/`: Stores the output figures and analysis results.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
git clone <repository_url> cd project



2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Findings

This analysis helps understand the relationship between order flow imbalance (OFI) and stock price movements. Further insights can be obtained by modifying the OFI levels and the lag period for the cross-impact analysis.
